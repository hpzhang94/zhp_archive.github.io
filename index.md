I am an incoming tenure-track assistant professor in the information and computer sciences (ICS) department at <a href="https://www.ics.hawaii.edu/"><u>University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa</u></a>. 

### I am looking for self-motivated PhD students, Master students, and research interns to join my research group!


## Biography

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Davis under the supervision of <a href="http://jiaweizhang.net/"><u>Dr. Jiawei Zhang</u></a>. I hold a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and two M.S. in Electrical Engineering / Computational Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). My research interests include natural language processing, generative AI, specifically on text summarization, multi-modal LLM, and LLM applications.
