I am a Computer Science Ph.D candidate at UC Davis, working with [Prof. Jiawei Zhang](http://jiaweizhang.net/).
Take a look at [my CV](./Haopeng_Resume.pdf).

My research interests lie in building graph models for natural language processing tasks. My recent work has focused on both extractive and abstractive summarization. In my spare time, I am fond of movies, video games, and traveling.

If you are interested in my research, or would like collaborate with me, you are welcome to [contact me](mailto:haopeng@ifmlab.org).

## I am actively looking for NLP postdoc and research scientist positions.

## Research Interests:

- Graph4NLP
- Summarization
- Graph Mining
